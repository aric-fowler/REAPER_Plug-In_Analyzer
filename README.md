# REAPER_Plug-In_Analyzer
Files for measuring the frequency and dynamic response of audio plug-ins using the REAPER digital audio workstation (DAW).

The analyzer is available in track template and project template formats. Both template use only stock (Rea or JS) REAPER plug-ins 
for analyzing a "plug-in under testing".

The current version (v1.0) currently supports L/R stero and mono plug-ins. M/S processing can be analyzed but requires routing
modification and the inclusion of the Mid/Side Encoder and Mid/Side Decoder JS plug-ins.

Any questions/comments/concerns regarding the analyzer can be directed at: aricdfowler@gmail.com
